# Automate your life
 It is painful to manually install all neccessary development settings. Development is consist of many accumulate actions to make things done. Productivity is the key to help you focus more.
 
 *Be smart! Let's integrate it into your workflow!*
 
### What is dotfiles

In short, it is something about configuration. For example, you can assign scripts into your .bash_profile to show your current git status and branching information inside your bash terminal. You will save a lot of time if you can have those information without any effort. Of course, there are more.
 
### Target Groups

 - OSX User
 - Development using Node.js
 - Development with Atom
 
##  Mounting
 
### OSX settings (configs/osx.sh)

You can toggle your preferred settings:

	# Disable the sound effects on boot
	sudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=" "
	
	# Disable smart dashes as theyâ€™re annoying when typing code
	# defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticDashSubstitutionEnabled -bool false

### Git Config

It is very common nowadays to use git. We simplify the git config in the following as example:

	[branch]
		autosetuprebase = always
		autosetupmerge = always
	
	[apply]
	  	# Detect whitespace errors when applying a patch
	  	whitespace = fix
	
	[alias]
		logs = log --oneline --decorate
		merged = branch --merged
	  	not-merged = branch --no-merged
	  	contributors = shortlog --summary --numbered
		rb = !sh -c \"git rebase -i HEAD~$1\"
		clean-fixed = !sh -c \"git branch --merged | grep fix/ | grep -v \\* | xargs -n 1 git branch -d\"
		push-gerrit = !sh -c \"git push origin @:refs/for/$1\"
		
	[push]
		default = current

### Terminal Config
 
- config/prompts.sh
- config/colors.sh
 
The above files gave the look and feel for development using Git:
 
	 <path>/<current dir> (branch name):

The line will look like this if there are any new changes:

	 <path>/<current dir> (branch name *):
 
### Alias

There are two main files of alias:

- alias/general.sh
- alias/dev.sh

Here are some examples:

	alias ip="dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com" 

	# Show/hide hidden files in Finder
	alias show-hidden="defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true && killall Finder"
	alias hide-hidden="defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool false && killall Finder"
	
	alias .....='cd ../../../..'
	alias desktop='cd ~/Desktop && open .'
	
	# application related
	alias gu='gulp'
	alias x='gitx'
	alias g=git
	
	# node related
	alias ni='node-inspector --preload=false &'
	alias nd='node --debug'
	alias cleanup='rm -rf node_modules'
 
## Installation
 To kickstart the development time on new machine, you just need to mount the dotfiles and run a simple command like this:
 
	df-install

Entry point: `install.sh`

Installation is base on the following orders:

1. OS Update
2. Homebrew
3. Development tools
4. Atom

		# give root permission to install system packages
		sudo -v
		
		# Update OS
		sudo softwareupdate -iva
 
### Installation: Homebrew and Apps (with just Brewfile)

It will install homebrew with brew cask.

You can just append the following to Brewfile, that's it.

	brew 'nvm'
	cask 'google-chrome'

 
### Installation: Atom and Packages

Atom installs packages via its own cli called `apm`.

You can add desired packages easily:

	# jumper
	apm install project-switcher # (cmd + ;)
	apm install line-jumper # (alt + up/down)
	
	# show color
	apm install pigments
	
	# linting
	apm install linter
	apm install linter-eslint
	
	# snippets
	apm install es6-javascript
	apm install react
	
	# git related
	apm install git-blame # (ctrl + b)
	apm install git-history # (ctrl + alt + h)
	apm install merge-conflicts # (alt + m + d)
	apm install show-origin # (ctrl + alt + o)
	apm install line-diff-details
	apm install branch-status

 
### Installation: Development settings (for node currently)

It will install the following libs to kickstart development process:
	
	xcode-select --install

	if [ -z "$NPM_VERSION" ]; then
	  nvm install $NPM_VERSION
	fi
	
	npm install -g gulp
	npm install -g babel-cli
	
	heroku update
	
	# to launch start mongodb at login
	ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mongodb/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
	
	# load mongodb now:
	launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist


Enjoy!
